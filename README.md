Tic-Tac-Toe (PvP & PvC using Minimax Algorithm)

This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides two gameplay modes: Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs Computer (PvC). In the PvC mode, the computer uses the Minimax Algorithm to make optimal decisions, ensuring that the AI is unbeatable. The purpose of this project is to combine front-end development skills with an application of artificial intelligence concepts in a simple game.

Features

Two gameplay modes: PvP and PvC
Computer opponent powered by the Minimax Algorithm
Responsive and user-friendly interface
Automatic detection of wins, losses, and draws
Simple and interactive design

The Minimax Algorithm is a recursive algorithm used in decision-making and game theory. It evaluates all possible moves in the game tree, assigns values to each outcome (win, loss, draw), and selects the best possible move. In this project, it allows the computer to always play optimally, making it impossible to defeat.
